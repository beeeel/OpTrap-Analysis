action count (n_reps)
    for each origin:
        action move to origin + offset (user def)
        action fluo
        action move to origin
        action count (n_count)
        action scope etc
        action move to origin + offset
        action fluo

count  inputs as [n_count, n_reps]
axis   inputs as [offset, 0, 0]
origin inputs as [X1, Y1; X2, Y2;...]

Unwrap quantification:
    Augment data with rotations
        Try simulated data rotations with the same noise - see if fitting converges on ground truth
        Unwrapping error could be reduced with this form of reprocessing
    Augment data with resampling
        Real data with real errors can be tested to determine sensitivity of technique
